      <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>greetings to everyone. i am a 20-year-old english student who's about to finish the major. i've created this "website" (or at least tried to) with the purpose of collecting all the things that constitute me in one place; thus, it contains all kinds of personal thoughts, whether well or poorly articulated, complete or incomplete for me to get to know myself, as i consider it (like some ancient philosopher) one of the richest objectives a human being can reach. <br />since my knowledge is far from being complete and vast, do not deem everything i write gets near the truth nor feigns to be it. this is a part of my relentless process of knowing everything that, from my perspective, matters the most.<br />my mother tongue is spanish, so the relevant content will be written in <em>espa&ntilde;ol</em>. however, i hold a weak desire to improve my second language, so i'll do my best to write some stuff in english. yet i always knew that "mi destino es la lengua castellana".<br />proceed, watch, read, and feel under your own risk.<br />sean indulgentes</p>
